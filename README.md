# Hybrid-Low-Radix-Approximate-multiplier
A Hybrid Low radix approximate Booth multiplier based on <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/339370491_Hybrid_Low_Radix_Encoding-Based_Approximate_Booth_Multipliers">this</a> paper.

I have implemented 2 designs : HLR-BM1 and HLR-BM2. Each these designs make use of Radix-8 booth encoding which has been modified to give approximate results in return for greater speed.
